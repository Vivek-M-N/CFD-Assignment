# CFD-Assignment

General: This repo contains the code to numerical solution of flow through porous media.

What is it? Two approaches have been taken to solving the problem numerically:
  - Constant number of grid points/ Changing grid size (complete with comparison to analytical soln.)
  - Constant grid size/ Changing number of grid points (incomplete due to lack of computing speed to run to convergence)

Also
  - Contains graphs plotted between numerical and analytical solution
  - Contains cubic spline interpolation function used for changing mesh approach
